Difference between xml and html

XML was designed to carry data - with focus on what data is
HTML was designed to display data - with focus on how data looks
XML tags are not predefined like HTML tags are

* The XML language has no predefined tags.
* The tags in the example above (like <to> and <from>) are not defined in any XML standard. These tags are "invented" by the author of the XML document.
* HTML works with predefined tags like <p>, <h1>, <table>, etc.
With XML, the author must define both the tags and the document structure.
