#BeautifulSoup object is provided by Beautiful Soup which is a web scraping framework for Python.
#Web scraping is the process of extracting data from the website using automated tools to make the process faster. 
#The BeautifulSoup object represents the parsed document as a whole. For most purposes, you can treat it as a Tag object.


# Import Beautiful Soup
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
  
# Initialize the object with a HTML page
soup = BeautifulSoup('''
    <html>
        <h2> Heading 1 </h2>
        <h1> Heading 2 </h1>
    </html>
    ''', "lxml")
  
# Get the whole h2 tag
tag = soup.h2
  
# Print the tag
print(tag)


#output --> <h2> Heading 1 </h2>
